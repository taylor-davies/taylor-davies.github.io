                    <br><br>
                    <h3>How I Addressed the Project</h3>
					<p id="textsmall">One of my favorite places is my local library, Bruton Memorial Library. Located in small town "itty bitty" Plant City, the strawberry capital, my logo embodies the spirit of both the library and the historic city it serves.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>What I Created</h3>
                    <p id="textsmall">I utilized the design elements below to develop my bespoke logo. <br><br>Shape: I wanted my design to be as simple as possible so that audiences know upon first glance what the logo represents. I designed my logo in the shape of a book to easily convey its meaning. The book is slightly open, conveying to the audience that there is a wealth of knowledge available at the library. Further, I wanted to make the logo stand out from other libraries in the area. Honoring its roots, I decided to place a simple outline of a strawberry at the bottom right of the logo. This, paired with the "1929" opening date, pays an homage to its history and the community it resides in.
                    <br><br>
                    Color: Before I started the design, I researched strawberry color palettes on Adobe Color to select colors that represent strawberries (#bf4643ff, #7d8f60ff, #ffffffea). Specifically, I chose a warm toned red to be inviting, invoking feelings of happiness and optimism. For the logo text, I selected a crisp white (#ffffff) to maximize legibility. To ensure accessibility, I tested the text-contrast ratio on Adobe Color. The text-contrast ratio passed WCAG 2.1 AA testing.
                    <br><br>
                    Composition: My intent was to create a logo that both honors the past and steps into the future. To do this, I curved the corners of the book and pages to create a modern feel. Further, the font selected (Playfair Display) is a serif that has a historic shape with a slightly modern feel. I did not want to venture too far into modern fonts, as I felt that a sans serif would not capture the heart and soul of Plant City. Playfair Display provides this careful balance and signifies trust, respect and history.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                    <p id="textsmall"> Through this project, I gained experience in Inkscape, an open source vector editing program similar to Adobe Illustrator. I have experience in Adobe Illustrator, which made learning Inkscape easier. Further, I enhanced my ability to create a vector image by hand. This is a valuable skill that will certainly be useful when developing educational materials. Ultimately, due to the open ended nature of the project, this was a great creative exercise that strengthened my abilities to work with vector graphics in vector graphic editing software.

					   <h3>How I Addressed the Project</h3>
                        <p id="textsmall">
                        It Ends With Us is a story centered around Lily, a young woman who develops a relationship with Ryle, a man she meets after her father's funeral. The reader follows Lily and Ryle as they build what appears to be a storybook romance – until one day, he loses his temper and strikes her. After a profuse apology, Lily dismisses it as a one-time accident. Then, the reader is alongside Lily as the "accident" happens again, and again. Lily's relationship with Ryle quickly becomes abusive, which forces Lily to reflect on her parents' abusive marriage. When Lily starts realizing she wants to leave, she becomes pregnant.​<br><br>

                        This book is the story of Lily's resilience. Lily grew up witnessing her mother being abused by her father and swore she would not fall into the cycle of abuse – until it happened entirely unexpectedly. At the end of the book, once Lily gives birth to her daughter, she gathers the strength and decides to break the cycle of domestic violence by divorcing Ryle. Though this is an incredibly difficult choice with long lasting consequences, she decided that she did not want her daughter to experience what her and her mother survived.<br><br>
                        In this project, I intended to create a book cover that appropriately represents the plot and the emotion it evokes.
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        
                        <h3>What I Created</h3>
                        <p id="textsmall">In my cover, the main component of the design is Lily emerging from a body of water. Below is a summary of the symbolism in this cover:<br>

                        Ocean: The ocean symbolizes Ryle's abuse, both physically and psychologically. Lily becomes immersed into his chaos, touching every aspect of her life. His abuse is suffocating and seemingly unescapable, especially after they marry. In this, the ocean is a perfect metaphor, as it is far reaching and poses the risk of drowning.​
                        Emerging from the Ocean: Lily stepping out of the ocean represents her strength and resilience in deciding to divorce Ryle and end the cycle of abuse.
                        <br><br>
                        White Dress: Lily's white dress symbolizes the pure spirit and intentions Lily had going into her relationship and marriage to Ryle. Further, it serves a second purpose by symbolizing the redemption Lily has when she finally decides to divorce Ryle and cleanse herself of his abuse.
                        <br><br>
                        Growing flower branch: The shower branch symbolizes the growth Lily experienced as a result of her marriage to Ryle and her own reflection on her parents' marriage. The flower branch was made a bit hazy to symbolize the unclear direction of her future, but despite the uncertainty, the growth continues.
                        <br><br>
                        Color of Title Shape: I selected the title shape's color (#aa7f57) from Lily's skin tone in the background image. This symbolizes the raw nature of the story, where the reader is alongside Lily in her most vulnerable moments. The reader is not shielded from the reality of abuse, experiencing all the extreme highs and lows right alongside Lily.<br><br>
                        Image Manipulation: Many of the manipulations made to the images were to make them brighter and warmer, symbolizing the brighter future she created for herself and her daughter. </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                        <p id="textsmall"> Through this project, I expanded my image editing and manipulation skills in Canva. I utilized a variety of techniques to create the book cover, carefully capturing the emotions in Lily's story. This assignment caused me to think critically about which details I include in my designs, as well as reflect on the educational materials I develop. When designing, it is crucial to include only the necessary details to avoid overload. However, the details that are included must adequately communicate the appropriate information to meet the objectives. Therefore, this was a great exercise that strengthened my abilities to create effective designs.
