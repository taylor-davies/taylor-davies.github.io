                    <h3>How I Addressed the Project</h3>
                    <p id="textsmall">For this project, I selected rapid intensification as my subject. This is a topic close to heart as my community was heavily impacted by Hurricane Milton this semester. Hurricane Milton was a dangerous storm that strengthened from a Tropical Storm to a Category 5 Hurricane in less than 24 hours.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>What I Created</h3>
                    <p id="textsmall">I created the animation video in Canva, using a blend of their video and animation tools. I created the voiceover in Audacity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Images: I selected the images from Canva Pro's stock library. I selected vector images that were low detail and recolored them to a basic color palette. My goal with the color choice and vector image choice was to provide basic visuals that could be easily and quickly processed. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Animations: I utilized a variety of animation techniques based on the information I was trying to convey. For example, when discussing damp air, I chose squiggly arrows moving in an upwards motion to convey the quick evaporation of sea water. Further, I coupled that with raindrops moving in the same upwards direction with an additional flicker effect to demonstrate just how damp and erratic the moisture is.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Meaningful Text: I included two pieces of meaningful text, careful to not overload the learners' visual channel. I made the text in an easy-to-read sans serif, DM Sans. The text is in a crisp black color to increase legibility (text-contrast accessibility). Accessibility was an especially important focus given the amount of animation in the clip.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Voiceover: I recorded the voiceover in Audacity. Once I finished my recording, I cleaned up the audio by (1) cutting out any mouse clicks, and (2) applying noise reducing effects. I utilized the Noise Reduction effect to decrease some of the background noises in the original recording.</p>
                    <br><br>    
                    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                    <p id="textsmall">In this project, I learned how to use Canva's animation tools to create a concise and engaging animation. Further, I gained an understanding of how impactful animations can be in educational materials. Animations allow for brief, yet memorable explanations of complex subjects, which can be especially important in adult learning.</p>
