                    <h3>How I Addressed the Project</h3>
                    <p id="textsmall">I created a screencast video on how to create an infographic in Canva. I chose the subject material due to my experience in developing e-learning materials in Canva.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>What I Created</h3>
                    <p id="textsmall">I created a screencast video on how to create an infographic in Canva.
                    First, I drafted a script to walk through each of the steps. Then, I drafted the infographic content and pre-selected a template. After, I did a few practice run-throughs, ensuring my mouse movement and typing speed weren't distracting to the learner. Then, I recorded the screencast in Camtasia. 
                    <br><br>
                        
                    Afterwards, I recorded the audio in Audacity. I prefer Audacity due to the Noise Reduction and Noise Gating effects. After recording the audio, adding effects and cleaning up any bad audio (clicks, breaths, etc.), I exported the audio to .mp3 and imported the audio into Camtasia.
                    <br><br>

                    After importing the audio into Camtasia, I edited the video and audio so that the audio instructions matched the video walkthrough.
                    To enhance the audio and visual, I added two effects. (1) I added a cursor highlight throughout the video so that the learner had a visual cue to where instruction was occurring. (2) I added a green arrow to enhance certain callouts, such as the custom size button and text editing panel. I purposefully limited the number of effects to avoid overload and keep accessibility in mind.
                    <br><br>

                    To draw the learner's interest and keep the learner engaged, I added an upbeat background audio track from YouTube Studio's library of royalty-free audio. Citing the song at the end of this post. I adjusted the audio to a low level to not distract the learner from the main narration.
                    After I completed editing in Camtasia, I exported the video and uploaded it to YouTube for sharing.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                    <p id="textsmall">I learned how to create an effective screencast in Camtasia. Further, I gained an understanding of the different effects and features that can make screencasts clearer, such as smart focus and cursor highlight. Further, this project pushed me to try different methods of video editing. I found this project to be the most challenging, but ultimately the most rewarding due to the skills and strategies I gained.</p>
