                    <h3>How I Addressed the Project</h3>
                    <p id="textsmall">In this assignment, I had to create a 2-minute video on a subject of our choosing, utilizing effective voiceover and video editing techniques. I chose the subject material due to my experience with my two Goldendoodle puppies.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>What I Created </h3>
                    <p id="textsmall">For my video, I drew upon my experience with my two puppies and created a video providing new puppy parents with tips to prevent destructive behaviors. I created the video in iMovie, the narration in Audacity, and the title cards in Canva.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Photos: I included over a dozen high-quality photos of my puppies, Rip and Ralphie.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Narration: I incorporated royalty-free music from YouTube Studio, cited at the end of my video. Further, I created the narration in Audacity, where I was able to record and edit with effects such as noise reduction.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Video Effects and Transitions: I applied panning, zooming and Ken Burns effect. I placed these carefully to avoid being overused in such a short video.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Text: I designed a formal title and credits, along with five meaningfully integrated screen captions. Each of the screen captions were created in Canva, then imported into iMovie. </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>What I Learned </h3>
                    <br>
                    <p id="textsmall">I expanded my skills in creating instructional videos. The video had to consist of images only, so it was a bit of a challenge as I am used to working with video. However, this challenge pushed me to learn more about video effects/animations and how they can bring content to life. Further, this project pushed me to be as concise as possible, as the time limit was only two minutes. Therefore, every piece of the video had to be meaningful, including a carefully worded voiceover script and concise on-screen text. This was crucial to both meet the time limit and prevent content overload.</p>
